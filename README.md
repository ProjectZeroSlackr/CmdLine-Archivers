Overview:
CmdLine-Archivers
- This is a collection of various command-line
  archiving tools ported to iPodLinux.
- Some of these have been recompiled while others
  are directly copied from their pre-compiled sources
  since they do not require recompilation.
- md5sum, sha1sum and sum have been added via busybox.
- For information on what each binary does, see their
  respective links below.

Usage:
- Since the "Bin" has been added to $PATH, all
  binaries are accessible to the shell and terminal.
  Thus they can be used in shell scripts or via the
  terminal module.
- Hold the centre/select button on an item in the
  file browser to access the archiving options.
- Note that bzip2 requires a bit of memory so if you
  are unable to compress with bzip2, reboot your iPod
  and try again. lpaq4 requires a lot of free memory
  (6MB for level 0 and 12MB for 1) and thus will not
  work with any GUI overhead (use from ZeroLauncher).
- lpaq4 was not ported to be functional but rather as
  a proof-of-concept port. While the compression level
  may be higher than bzip2 or gzip, do not expect it
  to be useful nor fast ; )
